# StructureFunction

This project provides code (`SF.py`) to determine the X-ray Structure Function of a population of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) for which two epoch X-ray observations are available and are separated by rest frame time interval $\Delta T$. The calculation of the X-ray structure function follows the Bayesian methodology described in Georgakakis et al. (2024) (https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08752). The data used in that paper to estimate the structure function of SDSS DRQ16 QSOs is available on zenodo.

The sampling of the likelihood uses the python wrapper of the Stan platform (https://mc-stan.org/) for statistical modeling and high-performance statistical computation. Installation of the Stan python wrapper (https://pystan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is therefore required to run the code.
